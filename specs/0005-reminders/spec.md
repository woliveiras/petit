# Spec: Local tasks and reminders

## Context and motivation

The caregiver needs reminders about pending care even while offline. The original reminder concept evolved into one-shot tasks.

## Functional requirements

- Create automatic tasks for upcoming vaccinations, deworming treatments, and enabled periodic weigh-ins.
- Create and edit a custom task, optionally associated with a pet.
- Schedule a local notification with WorkManager and complete or delete tasks.
- Cancel the schedule and soft-delete the linked task when the health record is deleted.
- Configure categories, advance notice, weigh-in interval, and default time.
- Filter active tasks and display completed-task history.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a next dose, When the record is saved, Then a linked task is created and scheduled according to preferences.
- Given weigh-in reminders are enabled, When a weigh-in is saved, Then the next task is created at the configured interval.
- Given a future custom task, When it is saved, Then it becomes `PENDING` and receives a local notification at the scheduled time.
- Given a pending task, When it is completed, Then it becomes `COMPLETED`, leaves the active list, and its schedule is canceled.
- Given a deleted linked record, Then its tasks are soft-deleted and its jobs are canceled.
- Given the device is offline, Then the local notification continues to work.

## Test strategy

Unit tests cover preferences, dates, and mappings; integration tests cover Room, AutoTaskService, and WorkManager; UI tests cover forms, filters, and completion.

## Out of scope

- Automatic task recurrence and notification snooze.
