# Plan: Local tasks and reminders

Spec: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Sequence

1. [x] Add unit tests for preference-based dates, overdue records, clock boundaries, and replacement/cancellation.
2. [x] Extract deterministic scheduling calculation and apply advance notice to vaccination and deworming tasks.
3. [x] Verify linked-task replacement, deletion, weight intervals, and WorkManager uniqueness at integration boundaries.
4. [x] Close unit and Compose gaps for custom tasks, filters, completion, and settings.
5. [x] Update the vaccination E2E journey to assert the configured scheduled instant.

## Architecture

- Tasks and notifications are local and one-shot.
- `referenceEntityId` links a task to the health record that created it.
- `PendingIntent` must be immutable; deletion and completion cancel the scheduled job.
- Routes: `tasks`, `tasks/form?taskId={taskId}`, `tasks/settings`, and `tasks/completed`.

## Dependencies and risks

- Depends on `0001` and receives events from `0002`, `0003`, and `0004`.
- Android restrictions on notifications and background execution require integration tests.
- Scheduling “now” must avoid flaky tests and negative WorkManager delays.

## Verification

1. Run focused `AutoTaskService` and scheduling tests after each slice.
2. Run `./gradlew test` and `./gradlew spotlessCheck`.
3. Run `VaccinationTaskJourneyTest` on an emulator.
4. Run `./gradlew assembleDebug` followed by `./gradlew installDebug`.
