# Spec: Local family group

## Context and motivation

After pairing devices, caregivers need to know who participates in sharing and
control access without a central account. The group is maintained locally, and
leaving it never deletes the pets' health history.

This spec consolidates the canonical `us-103-family-group` story; the
`us-103-household-group` variant contained only outdated navigation and a
wireframe, with no additional requirements.

## Current state

The member list, local removal, leaving the group, and DataStore preferences
already exist, but group creation persists state before pairing authorization
completes. Removal and departure are local database/preference operations; they
do not revoke the old key on another device. There is still no device renaming
or propagation of membership changes during a later transfer.

## Requirements

### Functional

- [x] Display known members and identify the local device.
- [x] Remove a member from the local list after confirmation.
- [x] Leave the group by removing the local key while preserving pet data.
- [x] Manage the group key, ID, and local name in group preferences.
- [ ] Allow the local device to be renamed.
- [ ] Propagate renaming, removal, and departure to other members.
- [ ] Display the last sync time or “never synced” for each member.
- [ ] Ensure that a removed device loses authorization for future syncs.

### Non-functional

- [ ] Consistency: repeated removal and departure operations must be idempotent.
- [ ] Privacy: health data remains local when access is removed.
- [ ] Accessibility: confirmations and destructive actions have appropriate labels and targets.
- [ ] Internationalization: visible text remains in `strings.xml` for pt-BR, en, and es.

## Test strategy

Unit tests cover the ViewModel and the rename, remove, and leave use cases.
Integration tests cover Room, DataStore, and propagation between two devices.
Blocking a removed member must be tested in the transfer channel and, when
available, in the LAN channel.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Given an existing group, when the screen opens, then it lists members, marks the local device, and shows each member's last sync.
- [ ] Given the local member, when its name changes, then the new name is persisted and appears on the other device after syncing.
- [ ] Given a remote member, when its removal is confirmed, then it leaves the list and cannot start a new sync with the previous key.
- [ ] Given a member that chooses to leave, when it confirms, then the key and local associations are removed, but pet data remains.
- [ ] Given an offline removal or departure, when the devices communicate again, then the membership change is propagated idempotently.

## Edge cases

- Group with no remote members or with duplicate names.
- Simultaneous removal on two devices.
- Removed device attempts a transfer using an old key.
- App closes between confirmation and persistence.
- Unknown last sync time.

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authority | Local state propagated between peers | Keeps the product free of a central server. |
| Leaving the group | Preserve all pet data | Stopping sharing does not mean deleting health history. |
| Identity | Stable UUID per device | Avoids using the editable name as a key. |
| Removal | Revoke the sync reference and propagate a marker | Prevents a merely visual deletion from being reversed at the next contact. |

## Out of scope

- Initial pairing, defined in spec 0101.
- Full history transfer, defined in spec 0102.
- Detailed sync history UI, covered in spec 0105.
- Administrative roles, remote invitations, and cloud-based group recovery; see spec 0405.
