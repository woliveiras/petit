# Spec: Vaccination records

## Context and motivation

The pet owner needs to maintain the vaccination schedule and traceability of the pet's doses.

## Functional requirements

- Record the vaccine type filtered by species, administration date, next dose, and optional veterinarian, clinic, batch, and note details.
- Require a custom name for the `OTHER` type.
- Calculate `OK` when there is no next dose or it is more than 30 days away, `SCHEDULED` when it is 0–30 days away, and `OVERDUE` when past due.
- Group history by type and display a visual status.
- Allow editing and soft deletion.

The catalog includes feline vaccines (`V3`, `V4`, `V5`, `FELV`, `FIV`), canine vaccines (`DHPP`, `BORDETELLA`, `LEPTOSPIROSIS`, `LEISHMANIA`, `GRIPE_CANINA`), rabbit vaccines (`RHDV`, `MYXOMATOSIS`), bird vaccines (`POLYOMAVIRUS`), and the general options `RABIES` and `OTHER`.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given a valid vaccination, When the pet owner saves it, Then it appears in the history and its status is calculated.
- Given a next dose in five days, Then the status is `SCHEDULED`; Given a past-due date, it is `OVERDUE`.
- Given a vaccine without a next dose, Then the status is `OK` and no next dose is displayed.
- Given multiple doses of the same type, Then the summary identifies the latest dose and the history preserves every administration.
- Saved optional traceability details are available in the detail view.

## Test strategy

Unit tests cover status and validation; integration tests cover persistence, grouping, and soft delete; UI tests cover the form, species filters, and visual states.

## Edge cases

- The next dose must be after the administration date; the administration date cannot be in the future.
- Rabies and `OTHER` are general options; all other types must match the pet's species.

## Known limitation

The implemented full history is grouped by month; the originally described presentation grouped by type has not yet been verified.
