# Specs Index

Index of all Petit specifications. Update this file when creating, approving,
implementing, placing on hold, or completing a spec.

Each capability lives in a global `specs/NNNN-<slug>/` folder containing
`spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`. Family and status are defined in the
`spec.md` frontmatter and reflected in the tables below. Folder organization is
based on capability families, while delivery state is tracked through status.
