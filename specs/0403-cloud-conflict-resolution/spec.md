# Spec: Cloud Conflict Resolution

## Context and Motivation

> As a user with multiple devices,
> I want edit conflicts to be resolved automatically,
> So that I do not lose data or have to resolve conflicts manually.

This cloud proposal has not been implemented. Spec 0105 is the local foundation:
the existing one-shot import compares UUIDs and `updatedAt`, but still lacks a
central resolver, complete soft-delete behavior, atomic logging, and convergence
tests. Cloud transport, remote listeners, and offline queue handling remain
entirely in this spec. The product, provider, availability, and monetization
must be revalidated before approval.

## Functional Requirements

### Scenario 1: Basic Last-Write-Wins

- [ ] This scenario is implemented and verified at the boundary defined by the test strategy.

```gherkin
GIVEN the pet "Luna" has updatedAt = 1000 on device A
AND device B edits Luna (updatedAt = 1500)
WHEN device A receives the change from the Firestore snapshot listener
THEN device B's version (the newer one) is retained
AND device A shows B's changes
```

### Scenario 2: Older Offline Edit

- [ ] This scenario is implemented and verified at the boundary defined by the test strategy.

```gherkin
GIVEN device A is offline and edits Luna (updatedAt = 1000)
AND device B edits Luna online (updatedAt = 1500)
WHEN device A comes back online and attempts to sync
THEN device B's version wins (higher updatedAt)
AND device A's changes are discarded
AND device A updates to B's version
```

### Scenario 3: Newer Offline Edit

- [ ] This scenario is implemented and verified at the boundary defined by the test strategy.

```gherkin
GIVEN device A is offline and edits Luna (updatedAt = 2000)
AND the Firestore version has updatedAt = 1500
WHEN device A comes back online and syncs
THEN device A's version wins (higher updatedAt)
AND Firestore is updated with A's version
AND other devices receive A's version
```

### Scenario 4: Delete vs. Edit

- [ ] This scenario is implemented and verified at the boundary defined by the test strategy.

```gherkin
GIVEN device A deletes Luna (deletedAt = 1500)
AND device B edited Luna (updatedAt = 1600) before receiving the deletion
WHEN sync occurs
THEN if the edit is newer than the deletion, Luna is restored
OR if the deletion is newer, Luna remains deleted
```

### Scenario 5: Different Fields Edited

- [ ] This scenario is implemented and verified at the boundary defined by the test strategy.

```gherkin
GIVEN device A changes Luna's name to "Lulu"
AND device B edits Luna's weight at the same time
WHEN sync occurs
THEN both changes are retained (if the strategy is field-level)
OR the newer version wins completely (if it is document-level)
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Preserve Petit’s local operation when authentication, the network, or an external service is unavailable.
- [ ] Protect personal and pet health data during storage, transmission, and deletion.
- [ ] Provide accessible, understandable loading, success, empty, and error states.
- [ ] Prevent silent data loss or duplication during interrupted operations.

## Test Strategy

| Scope | Expected coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Eligibility, validation, state, conflict, and data transformation rules. |
| Integration | Flows that cross the UI, repositories, local database, and external providers. |
| Both | Each vertical task uses unit tests for rules and integration tests for I/O boundaries. |

## Acceptance Criteria

The scenarios in **Functional Requirements** are this spec’s testable acceptance criteria and must have traceable coverage before the status advances to `Implemented`.

## Preserved Product Notes

### Resolution Strategy

### Document-Level (Current Implementation)

```
Rule: Last-Write-Wins based on updatedAt

Local:  { id: "1", name: "Luna",    updatedAt: 1000 }
Remote: { id: "1", name: "Lulu", updatedAt: 1500 }

Result: Remote wins (1500 > 1000)
        Local is replaced by Remote
```

### Field-Level (Future Improvement)

```
Local:  { id: "1", name: "Luna",    weight: 3.5, updatedAt: 1000, weightUpdatedAt: 1000 }
Remote: { id: "1", name: "Lulu", weight: 3.4, updatedAt: 1500, weightUpdatedAt: 900 }

Result: Merge
        name: "Lulu" (remote is newer)
        weight: 3.5 (local is newer)
```

---

### Edge Cases

### 1. Equal Timestamps
```kotlin
// If timestamps are exactly equal (rare), prefer remote
// This prevents sync loops
if (remote.updatedAt == local.updatedAt && local.syncStatus == "SYNCED") {
    return Resolution.KeepLocal  // Already synced
}
```

### 2. Large Clock Drift
```kotlin
// If the timestamp difference is unreasonable (> 1 year), something is wrong
val MAX_REASONABLE_DIFF = 365L * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 1 year in ms

if (abs(remote.updatedAt - local.updatedAt) > MAX_REASONABLE_DIFF) {
    Log.w("Sync", "Suspicious timestamp difference, preferring local")
    return Resolution.KeepLocal
}
```

### 3. Corrupted Data
```kotlin
// Validate data before accepting it
if (!remote.isValid()) {
    Log.e("Sync", "Invalid remote data, keeping local")
    return Resolution.KeepLocal
}
```

## Edge Cases

- The device loses connectivity or the process is interrupted midway through the operation.
- The session expires, switches accounts, or lacks sufficient authorization.
- Local and remote data diverge, are incomplete, or were created by different app versions.
- The external provider is unavailable, enforces quota limits, or changes its API.

## Decisions

| Decision | Current choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Proposal status | On Hold | Demand and the product model still need validation. |
| External technology | Not decided | Firebase, Google Drive, and the cited APIs are historical options, not current commitments. |
| Local source of truth | Preserve Room as the offline foundation | Keeps Petit useful without an account or connectivity. |

## Out of Scope

- Implementing this proposal before review, explicit approval, and an index update.
- Treating historical examples of pricing, tiers, providers, or schedules as current decisions.
- Capabilities covered by the specs declared in `depends_on`.
