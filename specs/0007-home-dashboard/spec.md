# Spec: Home dashboard

## Context and motivation

The caregiver needs a quick view of the pets' health and the care that requires attention.

## Functional requirements

- Display a welcome message and an action to add the first pet when there is no data.
- Display pet cards with photo, name, latest weight, overall status, and next event.
- Display up to five upcoming tasks and recent activity, with access to the full lists.
- Open the profile when the pet is tapped and provide Quick Add for weight, vaccination, deworming, task, and a new pet.
- Provide access to settings and manual refresh.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given there are no pets, When the home screen opens, Then the user sees a welcome message and a button to add the first pet.
- Given there are pets, When the home screen opens, Then the user sees an individual summary and visual health indicator.
- Given there are tasks, Then the user sees up to five upcoming tasks and can open the full list.
- Given there are health events, Then the user sees recent activity and can open the full timeline.
- When a pet or quick action is tapped, Then the app navigates to the profile or correct flow, prompting for pet selection when necessary.

## Test strategy

Unit tests cover aggregation and the empty state; integration tests cover repositories and navigation; UI tests cover states, Quick Add, refresh, and accessibility.

## Known limitations

- The “All good” banner and a separate alerts section have not been implemented.
- Quick Add replaced the original Speed Dial.
