# Spec: Home dashboard

## Context and motivation

The caregiver needs a quick view of the pets' health and the care that requires attention.

## Current state

The home screen supports the empty state, pet cards, upcoming tasks, recent
activity, Quick Add, settings navigation, and refresh. Pet cards display their
calculated health with accessible semantics; the dashboard distinguishes an
all-healthy state from severity-ordered care alerts and remains useful when a
secondary source fails.

## Functional requirements

- Display a welcome message and an action to add the first pet when there is no data.
- Display pet cards with photo, name, latest weight, overall status, and next event.
- Display up to five upcoming tasks and recent activity, with access to the full lists.
- Open the profile when the pet is tapped and provide Quick Add for weight, vaccination, deworming, task, and a new pet.
- Provide access to settings and manual refresh.

## Acceptance criteria

- Given there are no pets, When the home screen opens, Then the user sees a welcome message and a button to add the first pet.
- Given there are pets, When the home screen opens, Then the user sees an individual summary and visual health indicator.
- Given there are tasks, Then the user sees up to five upcoming tasks and can open the full list.
- Given there are health events, Then the user sees recent activity and can open the full timeline.
- When a pet or quick action is tapped, Then the app navigates to the profile or correct flow, prompting for pet selection when necessary.
- Given every pet has overall status `OK`, Then an accessible “All good” state is displayed.
- Given one or more pets are `SCHEDULED` or `OVERDUE`, Then they appear in a
  separate alerts section ordered by severity and next relevant date.

## Test strategy

Every changed production behavior receives a unit test. Unit tests cover
aggregation, empty/healthy/alert states, severity ordering, limits, and partial
source failures. Integration tests cover repositories and navigation; Compose
tests cover cards, alerts, Quick Add, refresh, and accessibility. A focused E2E
journey verifies that persisted health data reaches the dashboard indicator.

## Decisions

- “All good” is shown only when every displayed pet has overall status `OK`.
- `OVERDUE` alerts precede `SCHEDULED`; equal severity is ordered by the next relevant date.
- Pet cards always receive and display `overallStatus` with text/icon semantics, not color alone.
- Alerts complement rather than replace upcoming tasks and recent activity.
